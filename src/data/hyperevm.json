Here, we’re just selling pixels, cheap jokes, and god-tier sarcasm.\n\nEach NFT in Parodee is a visual meme disguised as serious art, just enough to make people question if it’s a masterpiece or an expensive joke. If you’re looking for utility, congrats! this NFT has exactly one function, to remind you that you just spent money on a funny picture that (probably) does nothing.\n\nThis collection was born out of boredom, a pinch of social revenge, and a noble mission to prove that \"absurd sells\". So get your wallet ready, brace yourself, and welcome to Parodee",
